# Font-Awesome-Plus-Mailchimp

Adding a Mailchimp Icon to Font Awesome using IcoMoon

This repo will be updated from time to time as the Font Awesome project adds more icons.  You can up vote adding this icon into FA here:

<https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/3379#issuecomment-238188409>

If you don't mind possibly slightly dated use the files in this repo in the folder ```icomoon``` you can look at the file ```demo.html``` to see if the icons you want from FA are there.

Otherwise you can always use IcoMoon to grab the newest FA version and re-add this one icon.  Here's How:

* Go to your [IcoMoon Projects Page](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects)
* Create yourself a new project (or load an existing one you like)
* Choose Add Icons from library
    * ![Add Icons](screenshots/1.png)
